# iCWLNet Website Builder Install
This is the latest beta install of my website builder. You only need to run this file on a php supporting server and it downloads 
and extracts the Bubble CMS Distributed edition. The Distributed version acts like a proxy for your domain to request and display your website on your webserver with changes are made from my administration server.

Firstly you have to download install.php place it in your root apache directory e.g. :- public_http
Run the file from your browser and fill in the required details. You should recieve an email and you will be forwarded to the central administration domain.

From here you can manage your websites details such as adding a page or even adding a free website. The administration lets you manage more that one website domain even on different servers.
